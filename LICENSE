The James Doyle image (static/james-doyle-mugshot.jpg) is from http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2012/08/mugshot-yourself-10-freaky-victorian-mugshots/ and is probably out of copyright. It's also a product of a government, so might be fair use on those grounds? Really not sure. But James, though almost certainly dead, likely wouldn't have minded either way.
